Assumptions:

Special contract is just a contract with a special clause.
To me it makes more sense to have a Domain this way than having a two types of contract.
It also makes the coding easier.

 Not setting the relationship with contract here on EMployee, TBD, 
 probably would be a one to one relationship, it could be an aggregate of employee
but  - when coding application I will decide.
